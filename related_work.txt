selected projects that could compile

4 code smells - 2 for classes, 2 for methods 
separate dataset for each code smell

We experimented our approach by selecting a set of suitable machine 
learning algorithms and testing them on the generated datasets, 
by means of 10-fold cross validation.

For each code smell type, a dataset has been created: 
two datasets for class-level smells (Data Class and God Class) 
and two for method-level smells (Feature Envy and Long Method).

Goal Question Metric approach
